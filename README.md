# Cryptoglyph
## Password Manager Application

Cryptoglyph is an 100% offline password manager android application which encryptes the password and shows them in the form of emotes. To view or copy the password to clipboard user can either use the master pin created in cryptoglyph application or can use the mobile screen lock. To ensure security cryptoglyph uses local database(SQLite) instead of hosting database in internet, also passwords stored in database are encrypted which cannot be accessed without knowing the secret key. Secret key is generated based on two sub keys one is static key which resides on the source code of app and another key is a dynamic user key which differes for every person. Exporting and importing from current phone to new phone can be done by pressing export button in current phone and sharing the exported file to new phone and then importing that file in new phone.
